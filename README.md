- Configured droplet on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

# Introduction

## What are Github Actions?

GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## What is DigitalOcean Droplet?

DigitalOcean Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware. Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.

In this tutorial, we'll use Github Packages as a container registry for our docker image.

> Note: GitHub Container Registry is currently in public beta and subject to change. During the beta, storage and bandwidth are free. To use GitHub Container Registry, you must enable the feature preview. For more information, see "About GitHub Container Registry" and "Enabling improved container support."

# Prepare our Node.js application

## Install dependencies

First of all, we need to create a `package.json` file.

The `package.json` file defines the dependencies that should be installed with your application. To create a package.json file for your app, run the command npm init in the root directory of your app. It will walk you through creating a package.json file. You can skip any of the prompts by leaving them blank.

```sh
$ cd path-to-your-repo
$ npm init
```

```
...
name: (nodejs-deploy)
version: (1.0.0)
description: Node.js on DO using Docker and Github Actions
entry point: (server.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author: First Last <first.last@example.com>
license: (ISC) MIT
...
```

The generated package.json file looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "name": "nodejs-deploy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on DO using Docker and Github Actions",
  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

To install dependencies, use `npm install <pkg>`. It installs the package and also adds it as a dependency in the `package.json` file. For example, to install `express`, you would type `npm install express`.

```sh
$ npm install express
```

Now your `package.json` file should look like this:

```JSON
{
  "name": "nodejs-deploy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on DO using Docker and Github Actions",
  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}

```

## Create `server.js` file

As you may see, we declared that our entry point is a `server.js` file. Let's create one.

This file would contain an `express` application with one simple `GET` endpoint, which would allow us to test deployment.

First of all, let's import `express` and declare our endpoint:

```javascript
'use strict';

const express = require('express');

const PORT = 8080;
const HOST = '0.0.0.0';

const app = express();
app.get('/', (_, res) => {
  res.send({
    message: "It's on DigitalOcean!",
  });
});

const server = app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`);
});
```

Now we can run our application and test if it works. To do this - type `npm start` or `node server.js` in your terminal.

```console
$ npm start
```

```console
Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Now let's check if our application is listening for requests by accessing http://localhost:8080. I'll use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for this.

And it works!

![Postman screenshot](./assets/postman-response.png 'Postman Screenshot')

Now we can proceed to dockerizing our application.

# Dockerize Node.js app

To achieve our goal, first of all, we need to create the `Dockerfile`. According to the documentation, a Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

## Simple Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM node

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN npm install
CMD "npm" "start"
```

You can already build and run your container and it will work, but maybe we can do it better? Of course!

Let's specify the version of the base image:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
```

Then let's take a look at the dependency installation. We're preparing a production build of the application, so we don't need dev dependencies to be installed. We can fix it by changing `RUN npm install` to:

```Dockerfile
# Install only production dependencies from lock file
RUN npm ci --only=production
```

Another step is to ensure that all frameworks and libraries are using optimal configuration for production. We can do it by adding this line to our `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Optimise for production
ENV NODE_ENV production
```

## [Don’t run containers as root](https://medium.com/@mccode/processes-in-containers-should-not-run-as-root-2feae3f0df3b#:~:text=Containers%20are%20not%20trust%20boundaries,a%20container%20on%20your%20server.)

It's really important to keep your process without security risks!

**Friends don’t let friends run containers as root!**

So, let's change few more lines in our `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Copy app files with permissions for node user
COPY --chown=node:node . /usr/src/app

# friends don’t let friends run containers as root!
USER node
```

Our application is listening on port 8080, so we need to expose this port from the container:

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
```

At this point our `Dockerfile` looks like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

# Optimise for production
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy app files
COPY --chown=node:node . /usr/src/app

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# friends don’t let friends run containers as root!
USER node

# Make port 8080 accessible outside of the container
EXPOSE 8080
CMD "npm" "start"
```

Let's build and run our image:

```sh
$ docker build . -t nodejs-deploy
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=nodejs-deploy nodejs-deploy:latest
```

You can check if it's running by typing the command:

```sh
$ docker ps
```

And you can see the container's logs with the following command:

```sh
$ docker logs nodejs-deploy
```

## Graceful Shutdown

Node.js has integrated web server capabilities. Plus, with Express, these can be extended even more.

Unfortunately, Node.js does not handle shutting itself down very nicely out of the box. This causes many issues with containerized systems.

When a Node.js application receives an interrupt signal, also known as `SIGINT`, or `CTRL+C`, it will cause an abrupt process kill, unless any event handlers were set, of course, to handle it in different behavior. This means that connected clients to a web application will be immediately disconnected.

Let's simulate this problem by creating another endpoint with delayed response:

```javascript
app.get('/delayed', async (_, res) => {
  const SECONDS_DELAY = 60000;

  await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(), SECONDS_DELAY);
  });

  res.send({ message: 'delayed response' });
});
```

Run this application and once it’s running send a simple HTTP request to this endpoint.

Hit `CTRL+C` in the running Node.js console window and you’ll see that the curl request exited abruptly. This simulates the same experience your users would receive when containers tear down.

### Part 1

To fix this we need to allow requests to be finished. Let's explain it to our Node.js server:

```javascript
// Graceful shutdown
function closeGracefully(signal) {
  console.log(`Received signal to terminate: ${signal}`);

  server.close(() => {
    // await db.close() if we have a db connection in this app
    // await other things we should cleanup nicely
    console.log('Http server closed.');
    process.exit(0);
  });
}

process.on('SIGINT', closeGracefully);
process.on('SIGTERM', closeGracefully);
```

This calls `server.close()`, which will instruct the Node.js HTTP server to:

- Not accept any more requests.
- Finish all running requests.

It will do this on `SIGINT` (when you press `CTRL+C`) or on `SIGTERM` (the standard signal for a process to terminate).

You may have a question "What if a request is taking too much time?". So if the container is not stopped, Docker and Kubernetes will run a `SIGKILL` after a couple of seconds (usually 30) which cannot be handled by the process itself, so this is not a concern for us.

### Part 2

Now in our `Dockerfile`, we're starting our application with the command `npm start`. Unfortunately, there is a big problem with this:

If `yarn` or `npm` get a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal, they correctly forward the signal to spawned child process (in this case `node server.js`). However, it does not wait for the child's processes to stop. Instead, `yarn`/`npm` immediately stop themselves.

The solution is not to run the application using npm and instead use `node` directly:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

But there still is a problem. Docker is running our process as `PID 1`. According to [Node.js Docker Workgroup Recommendations](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#handling-kernel-signals):

> Node.js was not designed to run as PID 1 which leads to unexpected behavior when running inside of Docker. For example, a Node.js process running as PID 1 will not respond to `SIGINT` (`CTRL-C`) and similar signals.

We can use a tool called `dumb-init` to fix it. It'll be invoked as `PID 1` and then will spawn our node.js process as another process. Let's add to our `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# Add tool which will fix init process
RUN apk add dumb-init
...
CMD ["dumb-init", "node", "server.js" ]
```

So the final version of our `Dockerfile` looks like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

# Add tool which will fix init process
RUN apk add dumb-init

# Optimise for production
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy app files
COPY --chown=node:node . /usr/src/app

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# friends don’t let friends run containers as root!
USER node

# Make port 8080 accessible outside of container
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["dumb-init", "node", "server.js" ]
```

And now we can proceed to our Github Actions!

# Configure the Github Actions

## Introduction

Go to your repository, select the `Actions` tab. You will see that GitHub is proposing you different workflows, but it's not our approach. Click on `set up a workflow yourself`.

![Set up workflow](./assets/setup-workflow.png 'Set up workflow')

We'll be redirected to the page with the initial config, it'll be committed to the `main` (`master`) when we'll finish our configuration.

Let's talk a little about the initial config, it should look like this:

```YAML
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

- `name` - is the name of our workflow
- `on` - is the block where we describe what will trigger our workflow. By default, it's triggered when a `push` is performed to the `master` branch (in this case `master` branch is accessed) or when a `Pull Request` is performed into the `master` branch (in this case will be accessed source branch, ex. `feature/TASK-1`). And we can trigger it manually, it's allowed by the `workflow_dispatch` property.
- `jobs` - is the block in which our jobs are configured. They can run one by one, or simultaneously (ex. deploying backend and frontend at once in mono repo).
  - `build` - is the name of our job. It contains its configuration.
    - `runs-on` - The type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.
    - `steps` - the place where our logic lives. Each step runs in its process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem.
      - `uses` - selects an action to run as part of a step in your job. An action is a reusable unit of code. In this case, is called predefined by GitHub action `actions/checkout@v2` which allow us to `checkout` the source branch (`master` or another one that triggered the workflow)
      - `name` - is the name of the step. It'll be shown in the progress of workflow execution.
      - `run` - runs command-line programs using the operating system's shell. If you do not provide a `name`, the step name will default to the text specified in the `run` command. It can execute a one-line command or multiline commands as well.

More detailed documentation you can find by accessing [Workflow Syntax Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Build and push

Now we have enough knowledge to start working on our configuration. Let's define the name of our workflow and when it'll be triggered. In our case workflow should be executed only on changes in the `master` branch or manually, so our declarations will look like this:

```YAML
name: Build, Push and Deploy Node.js app

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Now we need to declare some `env` variables to be able to reuse them in our configuration to avoid repeating the same things:

```YAML
env:
  REGISTRY: docker.pkg.github.com # we will push our docker-image to the GitHub packages
  REPO: tfarras/nodejs-deploy/nodejs-image # is the name of our image which will be used to push or pull it
  CONTAINER: nodejs-image # name of the container which will be used to stop or start the container
```

It's time to define our jobs. In our case there will be two jobs, one will build and push the image to the registry and another to pull and run the container on our droplet.

To build and push the container to the registry we'll use the `docker/build-push-action@v1` action, you can find detailed documentation [here](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action).

```YAML
jobs:
  push_to_registry: # name of our first job
    name: Push Docker image to GitHub Packages # User-friendly name which is displayed in the process of execution
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # this job should be run on the ubuntu-latest runner
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo # name of the first step, it'll `checkout` the latest commit in the master branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Push to GitHub Packages # name of the second step
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v1 # declare that we're going to use this action
        with: # block which receives configuration for the used action
          username: ${{ github.actor }} # github username
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # github password or github access token
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }} # our REGISTRY env variable declared in the section above
          repository: ${{ env.REPO }} # our REPO env variable
          tag_with_ref: true # Automatically tags the built image with the git reference. (from the doc)
```

At this point our workflow config should look like this:

```YAML
name: Build, Push and Deploy Node.js app

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  REGISTRY: docker.pkg.github.com
  REPO: tfarras/nodejs-deploy/nodejs-image
  CONTAINER: nodejs-image

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to GitHub Packages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Push to GitHub Packages
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          repository: ${{ env.REPO }}
          tag_with_ref: true
```

As you can see we're using `github.actor` and `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, and you most probably have questions, where we declared these variables. Answer: we don't.

These variables are predefined by GitHub.

- `github.actor` - is the login of the user that initiated the workflow run and takes part in the `github` context. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)
- `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` - is a token provided by GitHub. It's created on each workflow run. You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate in a workflow run. Learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).

This action can already be used if you want just to build and push your container. It's suitable if you just working on a docker-image and it should be only stored in the registry, and you need to be able to pull it when you need it.

But in our case we need also to deploy it, so let's configure our second job.

## Deploy: Pull and run

Our second job has the responsibility to connect to our droplet via ssh, pull the container and run the docker container. It'll also run on `ubuntu-latest` runner and it should start only after our previous job called `push_to_registry`. So, our job declaration will look like this:

```YAML
deploy: # name of the second job
  needs: [push_to_registry] # specify that it's dependent on the push_to_registry job
  name: Deploy to DigitalOcean # user-friendly name of the job
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest # specify runner
```

Before steps configuration, we need to add some more variables, namely `SSH_KEY`, `SSH_USER`, and `SSH_HOST`. These variables will be used to authenticate our ssh connection to the droplet. But like other secrets of our application, it's a very bad idea to store them in the repository files, so we need another, more secure, way to declare them. And GitHub provides one - it's called `Secrets` and you can find them in the `Settings` tab of your repository in GitHub.

Secrets can be of two types: Repository and Environment secrets. You can learn more about them in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).
In our case, we'll use Repository secrets, so go to the configuration page and click on the `New repository secret`.

As specified before, we need three variables:

- `SSH_KEY` - it's your private key used to access the droplet.
- `SSH_USER` - username used to access the droplet via `ssh`
- `SSH_HOST` - host of your droplet

Once they're set, you'll see the following result. These secrets cannot be seen again even by the repository owner, they can be only **updated** or **removed**.

![Secrets](./assets/secrets.png 'Secrets')

Now we can continue with our `steps` configuration. To perform `SSH` connection we'll use `webfactory/ssh-agent` action. More details and description you can find [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webfactory-ssh-agent).

Let's configure `SSH` connection:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup SSH connection # name of this step
    uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.1 # action which is used
    with:
      ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }} # provide private key which we added before
```

According to documentation, these actions will not update the `.known-hosts` file for us, so let's declare another step which will update this file using `ssh-keyscan`.

```yaml
- name: Adding Known Hosts
  run: ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts # run shell command which will scan and add hosts
```

Now it's time to add command which will pull our image to the droplet:

```yaml
- name: Pull latest container
  run: |
    ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker pull ${{env.REGISTRY}}/${{env.REPO}}:latest"
```

In this command, we specified that we need to connect via `ssh` using our `user` and `host` and run the command to pull the latest version of our docker image.

Now we need to run our container:

```yaml
- name: Start docker container
  run: |
    ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --restart unless-stopped --name=${{env.CONTAINER}} ${{env.REGISTRY}}/${{env.REPO}}:latest"
```

In this step, we also connect via `ssh` but let's take a closer look at the docker command

- `docker run` - runs the container itself
- `-p 8080:8080` - specifies that we need to bind exposed from the container port (`8080`) with the local port of the machine(droplet).
- `-d` - flag is used to run the container in detached mode
- `--restart unless-stopped` - specifies that the container should be restarted unless it's stopped manually. It also will start on the machine startup.
- `--name=${{env.CONTAINER}}` - specifies the name under which container will be started
- `${{env.REGISTRY}}/${{env.REPO}}:latest` - specifies which image we need to run as a container

At this point our configuration will look like this:

```YAML
name: Build, Push and Deploy Node.js app

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  REGISTRY: docker.pkg.github.com
  REPO: tfarras/nodejs-deploy/nodejs-image
  CONTAINER: nodejs-image

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to GitHub Packages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Push to GitHub Packages
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          repository: ${{ env.REPO }}
          tag_with_ref: true
  deploy:
    needs: [push_to_registry]
    name: Deploy to DigitalOcean
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Setup SSH connection
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.1
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}

      - name: Adding Known Hosts
        run: ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Pull latest container
        run: |
          ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker pull ${{env.REGISTRY}}/${{env.REPO}}:latest"

      - name: Start docker container
        run: |
          ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name=${{env.CONTAINER}} ${{env.REGISTRY}}/${{env.REPO}}:latest"
```

Look pretty good now, isn't it? But it has some issues which will fail our workflow if we'll run it now.

To pull containers from the github container registry we need to authenticate to this one. We'll do it also using `github.actor` and `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` variables. So let's add one more step before container pulling:

```yaml
- name: Login to the GitHub Packages Docker Registry
  run: ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker login ${{env.REGISTRY}} -u ${{github.actor}} -p ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}"
```

But for security reasons, it's not a good idea to leave docker authenticated to a registry on the remote machine, so we need to add at the end of our workflow to logout from the registry:

```YAML
- name: Logout from the GitHub Packages Docker Registry
  run: ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker logout ${{env.REGISTRY}}"
```

With these steps, we solved the authentication issue, but there is one more. On the second run, our workflow will fail.

**Why?** The reason is simple because the port and name of our container are already used from the previous run.

**How to fix it?** The fix is pretty simple, we just need to stop and remove the previous container. Let's add two more steps just before starting our container:

```YAML
- name: Stop deployed container
  continue-on-error: true
  run: |
    ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker stop ${{env.CONTAINER}}"

- name: Remove deployed container
  continue-on-error: true
  run: |
    ssh ${{secrets.SSH_USER}}@${{secrets.SSH_HOST}} "docker rm ${{env.CONTAINER}}"
```

You probably have a question:"_Why do we need `continue-on-error` property here?_". The reason is that these commands will throw an error if there isn't any running or existing container with the name of our container. It's not a problem for our workflow, so we'll just skip these errors.

The final version of our workflow configuration will look like this:

```YAML
name: Build, Push and Deploy Node.js app

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

```

Now we can commit and push your workflow to run into the `master` branch!

Workflow should be triggered automatically since we performed a `push` action to the `master` branch.

If you did everything right, you will not get any error in the execution:

![Result](./assets/result.png 'Result')

And now it's time to check our deployed application works on the remote server. Let's run a query to your `host:8080` or a domain if it's configured on your machine:

![Postman Result](./assets/postman-result.png 'Postman Result')

As you can see everything works great!

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we created a Node.js and dockerized it according to best practices and then deployed it using GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, and DigitalOcean droplet.

> Note: `GitHub Packages` can be substituted by another container registry according to the action documentation, and instead of `DigitalOcean` can be used another `VPS`. You're free to customize this configuration according to your needs.
